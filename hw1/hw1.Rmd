# Part 2

 1. How many persons are in the data set (statisticians call this n)? How many SNPs are in the data set (statisticians call this p)?
 

```{bash}
awk 'END { print NR }' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.fam
```
```{bash}
awk 'END { print NR }' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim
```
 * Answer: n = 959; p = 8348674

 2. Which chromosomes does this data set contain? How many SNPs are in each chromosome?
```{bash}
 awk < /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim '{print $1}' | uniq -c
```
  + Answer:  

 3. MAP4 (microtubule-associated protein 4) is a gene on chromosome 3 spanning positions 47,892,180 bp â€“ 48,130,769 bp. How many SNPs are located within MAP4 gene?
```{bash}
awk '{if ($1 = 3 && $4 >= 47892180 && $4 <= 48130769) print}' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim | wc -l
```
 * Answer: There are 12423 SNPs lovated within MAP4 gene.
 4. Reformat
```{bash}
 echo "    2.40  = FILE FORMAT VERSION NUMBER." > /home/huiyuhu/biostat-m280-2018-winter/hw1/merge-geno.lalala
 echo '8348674  = NUMBER OF SNPS LISTED HERE.' >> /home/huiyuhu/biostat-m280-2018-winter/hw1/merge-geno.lalala
 awk '{OFS = ","} {print $2, $1, $4}' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim  >> /home/huiyuhu/biostat-m280-2018-winter/hw1/merge-geno.lalala
 head /home/huiyuhu/biostat-m280-2018-winter/hw1/merge-geno.lalala
```
